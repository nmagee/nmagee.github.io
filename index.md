## About Me

I am a Solution Architect in the University of Virginia's Research Computing group. Most of my work centers on designing and building systems that support
research across academic disciplines. Lately that work has leaned heavily on containers, CI/CD, and orchestration.

## Teaching

In the Fall of 2020 I will be teaching [CS4740 Cloud Computing](/cs4740/).
