<p>This course investigates the architectural foundations of the various cloud platforms and examines both current cloud computing platforms and modern cloud research. Student assignments utilize the major cloud platforms. Prerequisite: CS 2150 with grade of C- or higher.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing has become an everyday term, but its meaning often remains unclear. For the purposes of this course, "cloud computing" makes up a specific way of creating, managing, and interacting with remote computing infrastructure and services, so-called IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).</p>
<p>We will discuss the technical, business, and practical reasons that cloud computing emerged, and the ways it has evolved in the last 15 years. Attention will be paid to the ways cloud computing - by empowering users to create and use infrastructure on demand and at scale - surfaces additional risks and requirements to the user, such as cost, security, and operational viability.</p>

  <h4>Fall 2020 - This course will be held entirely online</h4>
  <p>This course is being offered both <strong>ASYNCHRONOUSLY</strong> and <strong>SYNCHRONOUSLY</strong> in a flipped mode. Most lectures will be video streams to be watched or re-watched whenever the student chooses.
  Class discussion, more specifics of the content, and Q&A will be held in <strong>REAL-TIME each Thursday from 2:00-3:00pm EDT</strong>. Students will be expected to attend these discussions having viewed the lectures and completed all reading and external video assignments beforehand.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Audience</h3>
<p>This course will emphasize hands-on experience in the creation, management, and consumption of cloud-based services. For the purposes of getting started I will assume that you fit roughly into at least one of three categories as you approach the subject:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Developer</li>
  <li>Sysadmin / Systems Engineer</li>
  <li>Data Scientist / Researcher</li>
</ol>
<p>Students will learn how to create cloud resources according to best practices, with an emphasis upon creating reusable snippets of infrastructure-as-code.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tools for this course</h3>
<p>Students in this course will be expected to use the following pieces of software on a weekly basis:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://twitch.tv/nem2p/">Twitch.tv</a></strong> - This will be our primary platform for real-time and recorded lectures. Create a Twitch.tv account and verify your email address in order to participate in chat.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://discord.com/channels/732616151854743602/732616151854743606">Discord</a></strong> - Discord will serve as our hub for discussions, Q&A, and distributing extra material specific to topics or assignments. Create a Discord account and join the class server.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/">Git/GitHub</a></strong> - Students are expected to know how to version control their material using Git. Some programming assignments will require submission via commits pushed to GitHub. If you do not have a GitHub account, create one now.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://nmagee.github.io/cs4740/aws/">Amazon Web Services</a></strong> - All students will use AWS accounts and credits for this course. Please click the link to learn more about the AWS Educate program and your options for creating an account. We will also be using the <strong>AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">CLI</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">SDKs</a></strong> to interact with the AWS cloud programmatically. This will include the CLI interface and at least one SDK, preferably the <code>boto3</code> library for Python.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></strong> - You will need the Docker CE or Docker Desktop application for some portions of this course. All students should also create an account on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>.
</ul>

<a id="authors" class="anchor" href="#authors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Policy</h3>
<p>The course will be conducted according to the UVA honor system. Programming assignments and exams are to be completed by the individual (no group collaborations). You will sign an honor pledge for all homework, quizzes, and exams; more importantly, I expect you to adhere to the intent of the pledge. Cooperative efforts at understanding the material and the assignments of the course are encouraged.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors" class="anchor" href="#authors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students are expected to complete every reading and watch every lecture. Failure to do so will undoubtedly leave gaps in your understanding of the subject, and the specifics required for assignments and exams.</li>
  <li>You should never wait until the last minute to work on any aspect of this class. Computers and software can crash, and websites can have temporary outages. Keep close to the class schedule for readings, lectures, and assignments.</li>
</ul>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support or Contact</h3>
<p>If you are confused about any aspect of this course - a particular topic, method, concept, etc. - please contact the TAs or me via Discord. It is often the case that you're not the only one having trouble understanding it!</p>
