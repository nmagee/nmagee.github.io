## About

I am a Solution Architect in the University of Virginia's [Research Computing](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/) group. Most of my work centers on designing and building systems that support
research across academic disciplines. Lately that work has focused heavily on containers, CI/CD, and orchestration for bioinformatic and genomic research.

## Teaching

In the Fall of 2020 I will be teaching [CS4740 Cloud Computing](/cs4740/).
